# mlib

This repository is a personal python library made by *miracleyoo*. It contains frequently used functions and classes in domains which I am and was working on.

Currently, it mainly contains the following areas:

- Basic utils, like timer and logging setup.
- File and folder. Like make new directory while not destroy existing one, list directory with a bunch of conditions, backup file, stem and suffix direct output, and so on.
- Language functional support. Like property check for class input, lazy loader, some wrapper functions, etc.
- Debug utils. Like keep the context and dive into an iPython console when crash.
- 

It is still a little baby, but this is the repo I will constantly update and repair any bug. Feel free to try it and make PR! :-)
